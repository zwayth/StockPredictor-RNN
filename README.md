# Stock Prediction using RNN

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for predicting stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

## Features

- Data preprocessing for stock market data
- Implementation of RNN architecture
- Model training and validation
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Prediction and evaluation metrics

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python packages:

- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zwayth/StockPredictor-RNN.git
    cd stock-prediction-rnn
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook stock_prediction_RNN.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, evaluate it, and make predictions.
